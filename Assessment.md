Assessment for VR Urban Planning (856011)
================

This document contains information and marking criteria for the
assessment of VR Urban Planning (856011) module. It is designed to get
you started. <br/>

Assessment elements:

-   10% practicals attendance & Lab day attendance
-   10% report presentation
-   80% final report (to be submitted)

The information below provides guidance on the coursework.

## Content of the report

### Part 1: Theoretical

In the theoretical part of the report you are asked to **describe a
hypothetical study that you would like to conduct in VR in transport or
urban planning context**. The report should follow standard format of an
.Rmd file (as seen in the template
[here](https://github.com/martynabogacz/VR_Urban_Planning_2021/blob/main/rmarkdown_template.Rmd))
and to produce a report as seen
[here](https://github.com/martynabogacz/VR_Urban_Planning_2021/blob/main/rmarkdown_template.md).
It should address the following points:

-   Research question
-   Motivation of your study
-   Identified research gaps supported by a literature review
-   Discussion of the advantages and potential disadvantages of VR use
    relative to traditional research approaches *in the chosen case*
-   Hypotheses
-   Experimental setup
-   Description of methodology (eg. VR technique & any other equipment,
    type of scenarios)
-   Planned data analysis (including potential challenges)
-   Expected outcomes of the case study
-   References

Before you start writing your report think of the following aspects:

-   What kind of topics and research questions are you interested in?
-   What questions do you want to explore?
-   How would you process the data?
-   What would the exploratory data analysis involve
    (e.g. visualisation, describing the data)

As stated above, the report should describe a **hypothetical** study,
hence in this part of the report you *are not* required to analyse any
data.

### Part 2: Practical

As a second part of the report you are asked to **conduct the cleaning,
pre-processing and analysis of the data that you collected during the
Lab day**. The aim of this part is to demonstrate your data science
skills that you learned or developed during the course. For this reason
you are asked to submit a .zip file that contains:

-   .Rmd file that contains all the code that you used to work with your
    data (To ensure the document is reproducible, you should include a
    code chunk that shows which packages you used)
-   A pdf file that is created based on the .Rmd file
-   Data files

This will ensure that the code is reproducible.

## Assessment submission

-   Deadline: Friday 16th Dec, midnight
-   Format: a zip file containing a PDF file (a single file for both
    parts of the report), .Rmd file and data file(s)
-   3000 words maximum, excluding code and references

The report template in .Rmd format can be accessed
[here](https://github.com/martynabogacz/VR_Urban_Planning_2021/blob/main/rmarkdown_template.Rmd).

“rmarkdown” phrase) or [Chapter

## Presentation

Date: 6th Dec 2022

You are asked to prepare a 15 min. presentation in which you will give
an overview of your report. It is a compulsory part of the assessment
and it is not possible to pass without the presentation. It will give
you an opportunity to receive feedback on your work before the deadline
for report submission.

## Grades

Grades are awarded based on the following criteria:

### Theoretical

-   Topic selection, including originality and relevance to solving
    transport and urban planning problems
-   Discuss alternative topics considered and justify the choice of
    topic
-   Discuss why it is suitable to be conducted using immersive
    technologies
-   Discuss limitations of the research
-   Explain the potential impacts of the work

### Practical

-   Effective use, manipulation and joining of different datasets
-   Demonstrated understanding of undertaken steps, for example, by
    detailed description of their aims
-   Evidence of data cleaning techniques and adding value to the
    dataset, for example by creating new variables etc.
-   Creation of figures that are well-described, useful and add value to
    the analysis
-   Make sure that the document is reproducible

Grades will be announced in January.
